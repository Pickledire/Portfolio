## üòé Overview

A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing my development skills and projects. Built with React and featuring smooth animations, interactive components, and a clean, professional design. The new IOS 26 and Aayush Bharti's portfolio: https://aayushbharti.in/ as concept for what I was going for.

Thanks for being here.
